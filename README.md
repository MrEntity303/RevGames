# ST1121-WebMobileApplicationsProgramming - RevGames

The project consists of building a Single Page Application that allows users to register, log in, and leave reviews on video games. Of course, it will still be possible to view all reviews displayed on the site without logging in.

In addition to regular users, there will also be an admin user who will have the ability to add video games through the dedicated section.
